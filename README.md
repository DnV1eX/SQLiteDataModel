# SQLiteDataModel

SQLiteDataModel is able to create and migrate versions of SQLite databases using Data Model and Mapping Model documents, abandoning Core Data managed objects. Thus, you can visualy design a database model in Xcode and access it directly through the SQLite library or your favorite Swift wrapper.
